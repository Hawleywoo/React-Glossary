# React Glossary

### npm
A command line tool for handling packages of reusable JavaScript code designed to be shared.

### package.json
A list of dependencies, or what packages are required for a given js application. You can check for its presence by running “npm test” which will return “hotdog”. Running npm init  will create or edit an existing package.json file.

### npm install
Reads the package.json file and downloads the packages from npmjs.com where they are hosted. Will likely result in a dependency tree because the packages have dependencies, which have dependencies etc. To install a package in our local JSON file, run npm install followed by the package name.

### node
A JS runtime, allowing JavaScript to be run locally on your computer, instead of in a browser. A runtime is the period in which a computer is executing or software designed to support the execution of computer programs.

### framework
A standardized way of creating and deploying web applications.

### React
A JS framework with a specific way for designing and structuring a JS app, it offers both performance and composition benefits through its virtual DOM and JS extension, JSX.

### virtual DOM
The virtual DOM is a programming concept where an ideal("virtual") representation of a UI is kept in memory and synched with the real DOM. This is what enables React to be declarative meaning you can tell React what you want the UI to look like (the virtual DOM) and it will make the actual DOM match it without you having to do the manual DOM manipulation required in vanilla J.S.

### Babel
A transpiler that converts JSX into vanilla JS.

### Webpack
An open-source JavaScript module bundler.

### JSX
An extension of vanilla JS similar to html, it follows a declarative writing structure meaning you can express what you want the UI to look like and JSX will take care of the rest.

### declarative vs. imperative(style of programming)
To write imperative code is to write how something is done in detail(written *explicit* steps). Declarative means you write what you would *like* to do. Most vanilla JS is imperative. React is considered declarative because you can create the structure of the UI without giving it the explicit commands necessary for DOM manipulation in traditional JS.


### modular code
Code that is separated into separate files with each module being responsible for a single feature or functionality. Reasons you would want to separate your code into modules:
- adhere to the single responsibility principle
- easier to navigate
- easier to debug
- produces clean and DRY code (DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself vs. WET - Write Everything Twice)

### component
Components modularize both functionality and presentation in our code, letting us split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, freeing us to think about each piece in isolation.

### component chain
The practice of linking files through importing and exporting.

### export default
We export to allow other files to import a files contents. Export default lets us denote that whatever follows that statement is the main thing we want to export.

### dynamic vs static components
A static component - also known  as a presentational or stateless component - is a component whose sole responsibility is rendering data passed down from the parent. A dynamic component may or may not include state, but does allow for user interactivity.

### props
Props - short for "properties" - are reusable values that are passed down from a parent component to a child component. Props can be any datatype.

### default props
A prop value assigned by the component responsible for rendering the props in the case that the props it receives are not what is expected and/or wanted. Default props should be used in the child component as opposed to conditional logic in the parent component passing the props to adhere to the single responsibility principle.

### callback function
Generally speaking, a callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. In the context of React, we send a callback function down from a parent component as props to a child. When the callback is invoked (an action), it can send data or change state in the parent component that owns it. The parent can then share that data with all of its children - including any siblings of the component that received the callback. Hence, what we mean by data down, actions up.

### the recursive component
A component that calls itself. Recursion is an example of a tree problem - the flow and logic resemble a tree structure.
Three main constructs are required to implement recursion with a component:
1. The seeder  - the initial value received as props
2. the invariant - the separate method that allows the component to call itself
3. the base case - this is the point at which the function should cease recursion (otherwise we’d overwhelm the call stack)

### arrow functions in React
By using the arrow function, we implicitly bind a method to our class, thus preventing *this* from changing value and causing bugs when we use callbacks.

### the ternary in React
A method for conditionally rendering elements inline.
Its basic syntax is condition ? true : false.

### state
Data that is mutated in a component's life. Through the use of state, we can update and maintain information within a component instead of having to rely on a parent.

### this.setState()
A built in function used to update state in a *non-blocking* manner and alert React to re-render. This.setState() is asynchronous and waits for the component to finish performing its task before updating state. That this built in function alerts React of a change in state and therefore a need for a re-render is in contrast to the inefficient process of "dirty checking" which runs checks for changes of state instead of being alerted. Dirty checking is practiced by Angular, a rival framework

### synthetic events
An api wrapper which enables React to standardize how events are handles across all browsers.

### event pooling
Event Pooling is a performance increase that allows for synthetic event objects to be re-used by nullifying all values when the callback is invoked by an event. Whenever an event fires, the event's object is sent to a callback and "scrubbed" up for later use. This prevents you from accessing the event in an asynchronous way, however if you would like to, you can save it to a variable or call event.persist().

### supported events
Events with built-in React handlers that are triggered by an event in the bubbling phase. Here is a list of built-in event handlers: https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events

### event bubbling vs capturing
Event bubbling is when an event is first captured and handled by the inside element before before propagated to the outside elements. Event capturing (aka trickling) is when the event is first captured by the outermost element and the propagated to the inner most element. Trickle down, bubble up.

### controlled form
Unlike uncontrolled forms which can only have static display values passed down from a parent as props, a controlled form sets default values in state and derives its input values from state thus granting us control to render and restrict our inputs in time with the user.

### onChange
a built-in event which invokes an anonymous function that takes in the event as an argument. It is heavily employed in a controlled form to show live updates for what the user is inputting by making a an input field its target: it is triggered when ever the user strikes a key.

### onSubmit
A built-in event which invokes an anonymous function whenever a user hits enter/clicks submit. The anonymous function will then call a function for handling the submit event.
